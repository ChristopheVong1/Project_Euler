Description:

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the 
following formulae:

Triangle: Tn=n(n+1)/2
Pentagonal: Pn=n(3n−1)/2
Hexagonal: Hn=n(2n−1)

It can be verified that T285=P165=H143=40755.

Find the next triangle number (after 40755) that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

Solution:

- We can brute force the solution by testing every triangle number
- First we need to write a function to check if a number is pentagonal 
and hexagonal. It is possible to solve the equation by putting x instead of Pn or Hn.
- Then we test every triangle number after n=285 until we find the answer

- We already have a function that check if a number is pentagonal (see 
problem 44)
- H(n)=T(2n-1) by using the equations so every hexagonal numbers are 
triangular
- Instead of generating triangle numbers, we can just generate 
hexagonal numbers (already triangle), use the formula to check if pentagonal, we return the first answer.
