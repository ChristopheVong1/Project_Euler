Problem:

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural 
numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be:
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28

The first ten terms would be:
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five 
divisors (1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28).

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five 
hundred divisors?

Solution:
