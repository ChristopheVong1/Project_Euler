Description:

If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words (in English), they are:

    1 → "one" (3 letters)
    2 → "two" (3 letters)
    3 → "three" (5 letters)
    4 → "four" (4 letters)
    5 → "five" (4 letters)

The total number of letters used for numbers 1 to 5 is:
3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were
written out in words, how many letters would be used?

Solution:

We make a list of every value for every number from 1 to 1000 depending on how many letters we need.

From 1 to 20:
1 = "one"
2 = "two"
3 = "three"
4 = "four"
5 = "five"
6 = "six"
7 = "seven"
8 = "eight"
9 = "nine"
10 = "ten"
11 = "eleven"
12 = "twelve"
13 = "thirteen"
14 = "fourteen"
15 = "fifteen"
16 = "sixteen"
17 = "seventeen"
18 = "eighteen"
19 = "nineteen"
20 = twenty"

From 21 to 99: we make combination using the previous number and the following
30 = "thirty"
40 = " forty"
50 = "fifty"
60 = "sixty"
70 = "seventy"
80 = "eighty"
90 = "ninety"

From 100 to 999: We need to add the number 100 and "and" 
100 = "one hundred"

For 1000: it is "one thousand"
