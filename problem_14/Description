Problem:

The Collatz sequence is defined for any positive integer n as follows:

    If n is even: n→n/2

    If n is odd: n→3n+1

The sequence terminates when n reaches 1.

Example (for n=13):
13→40→20→10→5→16→8→4→2→1(Length: 10 terms)

Find the starting number (under one million) that produces the longest Collatz chain.

Solution:

Brute forcing by testing every number from 1 to 1_000_000 and creating a list containing the length of each chain.
- Test every number from 1 to 1_000_000
- Create a list that creates the Collatz sequence
- Add to a final list the length of the sequence
- Find the longest chain among the final list and use its index to find the starting number
