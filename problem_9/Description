Problem:

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a<b<c, for which, a²+b²=c².

For example, 3²+4²=9+16=25=5².

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a+b+c=1000.
Find the product abc.

Solution:

We can do brute forcing by testing every combination but we first need to restrict the range for each letters.

- a, b and c are natural numbers, the lower limit is 1.
- Because a<b<c and a+b+c=1000, the upper limit of a is 1000/3=333.
- The upper limit of b is (1000-a)/2 if b=c in the worst case.
- For every a from 1 to 333, we test every b, b>a up to its upper limit.
- We calculate a²+b²=c² and we calculate if c is a natural number.
- If the conditions are completed, we calculate abc.
