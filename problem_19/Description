Description:

You are given the following information but you may p0fezr to do some research for yourself.

- 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
- Thirty days has September, 
 April, June and November.
 All the rest have thirty-one,
 Saving February alone,
 Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
 And on leap years, twenty-nine.
- A leap year occurs on any year divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month (e.g., 1st January, 1st February, etc.) during the 20th century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

Solution:

- We know that 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday (start point) but we only consider Sundays from 1 Jan 1901.
- 1900 is not a leap year (because of century rules).
- We only check the first day of each month
- We need to find the day of the week for the 1st of each month.
- We have to consider leap year for February (28 or 29 days) which will shift the weekday.
- There is a module called "datetime" with the function weekday() which return the weekday of a specific date.
- Then we just need to find a way to loop every date from 1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000
