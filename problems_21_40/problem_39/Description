Description:

If p is the perimeter of a right-angled triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120:

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000 is the number of solutions maximised?

Solution:

- We want a right angled triangle, meaning a2+b2=c2. Also, a, b and c must be integer values. 
- We can test every value of p<=1000 then find triplet a,b and c, such that a2+b2=c2; a+b+c=p; and a <= b and b < c.
- a must be < p/3.
- For a specific value a, we can find b and c using both equations.
- Then we checked that b is an integer, which would mean that c is also an integer.
- We repeat this operation until we get every triplet for a given p and store the value to compare with other p values
- We return the p giving the highest number of triplet.
