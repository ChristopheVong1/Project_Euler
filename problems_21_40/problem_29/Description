Description:

Consider all integer combinations of aᵇ for 2 ≤ a ≤ 100 and 
2 ≤ b ≤ 100. How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by 
aᵇ for these ranges of a and b?

Solution:

- We can brute force it because there is around 10000 combinations
- Python can handle large numbers without overflow
- Then we can use a set to only have unique term and find the size of the set
