Description:

The decimal number, 585 = 1001001001â‚‚ (binary), is palindromic in both bases (decimal and binary).

Find the sum of all numbers less than 1,000,000 that are palindromic in base 10 (decimal) and base 2 (binary).
(Note: The palindromic number must not include leading zeros in either base.)

Solution:

- We need a function to check if a number is a palindrome or not (easy)
- We need a function to convert a number from base 10 to base 2
- We can brute force every number from 0 to 1_000_000
- Compute the sum of double base palindrome
