Description:

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise 
direction, a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

21 22 23 24 25
20  7  8  9 10
19  6  1  2 11
18  5  4  3 12
17 16 15 14 13

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals (from 
both center to corners) is 101 (i.e., 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 13 + 17 + 21 
+ 25).

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral 
formed in the same way?

Solution:

- We try to avoid brute forcing it because a matrix of 1001*1001 (or around 1_000_0000 numbers) though it is possible
- We need to use math to find the values of the two diagonals
- Center is always 1
- The size of the spiral is always odd 1*1, 3*3, 5*5, ..., 1001*1001
- If k-th is the number of the ring with k=0 for center, k=1 for 3*3 ring, k=2 for 5*5 ring
- The side length of the spiral at layer k is 2k+1 (so minus 2k to go from a corner to another adjacent corner)
- Then the top right corner is always (2k+1)**2
- Then the top left corner is always (2k+1)**2-2k
- Then the bottom left corner is always (2k+1)**2-4k
- Then the bottom right corner is always (2k+1)**2-6k
- Then the sum of the four corner at layer k is: 16kÂ²+4k+4
- Finally we repeat the formula from k=0 to k=500 and sum the full result to get the answer
