Description:

Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula: n**2+n+41

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive 
integer values 0≤n≤39. However, when n=40, 40**2+40+41=40(40+1)+41 is 
divisible by 41, and certainly when n=41, 41**2+41+41 is clearly 
divisible by 41.

The incredible formula n**2−79n+1601 was discovered, which produces 80 
primes for the consecutive values 0≤n≤79. The product of the coefficients, 
−79 and 1601, is −126479.

Considering quadratics of the form:
n2+an+b where ∣a∣<1000 and ∣b∣≤1000, and ∣n∣ is the modulus/absolute value 
of n (e.g., ∣11∣=11 and ∣−4∣=4).

Find the product a×b for the quadratic expression that produces the 
maximum number of primes for consecutive values of nn, starting with 
n=0.

Solution:

- We can brute force it.
- We need to test every value from -999 to 999 for a, -1000 to 1000 for b7
- Then for each pair (a,b), we test every n starting from 0 and we check
if the result is a prime number
- We store the pair (a,b) that manage to produce the highest n
- We return the product a*b
