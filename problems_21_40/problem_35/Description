Description:

The number 197 is called a circular prime because all rotations of its digits (197, 971, 719) are also prime.

How many circular primes are there below one million?

Solution:

- We can brute force by testing every number under one million
- Every number that contains 0,2,4,5,6,8 can't be circular because we can put them as last digit, which will make them divisible
- Single digit 2 and 5 are allowed
- We need a function to test if a number is prime
- We need another function to find every number related to that number using digit rotations
- To do the rotation of a number with d digit, we move the first digit to the end d-1 times
