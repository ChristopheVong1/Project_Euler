Description:

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂, where F₁ = 1 and F₂ = 1.

The first 12 terms of the Fibonacci sequence are:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144.

The 12th term, F₁₂ = 144, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to 
contain 1000 digits?

Solution:

- We can just brute force it
- We need a function to count the number of digit for a Fibonacci number
- We need another function to calculate the next Fibonacci number
