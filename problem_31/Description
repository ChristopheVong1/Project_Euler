Description:

In the United Kingdom, the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence 
(p). There are eight coins in general circulation:

1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).

How many different ways can £2 (200p) be made using any number of these coins?

Solution:

- The method is to use Dynamic Programming (DP)
- We need to find combinations of coins, the order doesn't matter
- We create an array dp where dp[i] is the number of ways to make amount i. We start at dp[0]=1 (no coins)
- Then we update dp until we reach 200p
- Too difficult to understand, so i skip the program
