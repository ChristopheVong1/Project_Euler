Problem:

Starting in the top-left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to 
move right or down, there are exactly 6 routes to reach the 
bottom-right corner.

How many such routes exist through a 20×20 grid?

Solution:

It seems that the problem is about counting the number of unique permutations of moves (right/down). For a n*n grid, you must take exactly n right and n down in any order.

The solution is the central binomial coefficient (or combination).
Number of paths = (2n)!/(n!)²
For instance, for 2*2 grid, "2 parmi 4" = 6 paths
