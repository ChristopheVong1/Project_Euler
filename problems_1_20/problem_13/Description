Problem:

Work out the first ten digits of the sum of the following one-hundred 50-digit numbers

Solution:

It is just a sum of numbers so just do it ?
- Need to parse the huge list of number, there is a 100 line of 50-digit numbers
- Make the sum
- Convert the value into an iterable/string and return the first ten value
