Problem:

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Solution:

- Make a list of all multiples of 3 or 5 below X (only natural number). To do so, we can loop (for or while from 0 to X and use % to check if the number is a multiple or not)
- Sum the list
