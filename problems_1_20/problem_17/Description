Description:

If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words (in English), they are:

    1 → "one" (3 letters)
    2 → "two" (3 letters)
    3 → "three" (5 letters)
    4 → "four" (4 letters)
    5 → "five" (4 letters)

The total number of letters used for numbers 1 to 5 is:
3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were
written out in words, how many letters would be used?

Solution:

We make a list of every value for every number from 1 to 1000 depending on how many letters we need.

From 1 to 20:
1 = "one" = 3
2 = "two" = 3
3 = "three" = 5
4 = "four" = 4
5 = "five" = 4
6 = "six" = 3
7 = "seven" = 5
8 = "eight" = 5
9 = "nine" = 4
10 = "ten" = 3
11 = "eleven" = 6
12 = "twelve" = 6
13 = "thirteen" = 8
14 = "fourteen" = 8
15 = "fifteen" = 7
16 = "sixteen" = 7
17 = "seventeen" = 9
18 = "eighteen" = 8
19 = "nineteen" = 8
20 = twenty" = 6

From 21 to 99: we make combination using the previous number and the following
30 = "thirty" = 6
40 = " forty" = 5
50 = "fifty" = 5
60 = "sixty" = 5
70 = "seventy" = 7
80 = "eighty" = 6
90 = "ninety" = 6

From 100 to 999: We need to add the number 100 and "and" (= 3)
100 = "one hundred" = 10

For 1000: it is "one thousand" = 11
