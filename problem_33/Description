Description:

The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly cancel the 9's and think that 49/98 = 4/8 (which is correct, but for the wrong reason).

We consider fractions like 30/50 = 3/5 to be trivial examples (since they involve cancelling zeros).

There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.

If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.

Solution:

- We can brute force the solution by testing every 2 digit number division (10 to 99) for a/b.
- To be faster, the result must be a fraction so a<b
- To be faster, a and b must have a common digit (but not 0 because they are trivial)
- We need a function to detect if the fraction fulfill the condition of the problem
- We return the product of the four fractions
