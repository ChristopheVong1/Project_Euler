Description:

Let d(n) be the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which
divide evenly into n).

Two numbers a and b are called an amicable pair if:

    d(a)=b,
    d(b)=a,
    and aâ‰ b.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22,
44, 55, and 110; their sum is 284. 
The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142; their sum is 220. 
Thus, 220 and 284 form an amicable pair (d(220)=d(284)).

Find the sum of all amicable numbers under 10,000.

Solution:

- We need a function to calculate the proper divisors of n (d(n)) and the sum of their divisors.
- Then we need a function to find if 2 numbers are amicable.
- In order to do so, we calculate d for every number under 10000.
- Then we check if the numbers are amicable pair and put them on a list. 
- We sum the final list.
