Description:

Take the number 192 and multiply it by 1, 2, and 3:

    192 × 1 = 192
    192 × 2 = 384
    192 × 3 = 576

By concatenating each product, we get the 1 to 9 pandigital number 
192384576. A pandigital number is one that contains all digits from 1 
to 9 exactly once.

Similarly, for 9:

    9 × 1 = 9
    9 × 2 = 18
    9 × 3 = 27
    9 × 4 = 36
    9 × 5 = 45

Concatenating gives 918273645, which is also a 1–9 pandigital.

What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be 
formed as the concatenated product of an integer ( > 0) with (1, 2, 
..., n) where n > 1.

Solution:

- We need to find a number that can be concatenated by at least two numbers.
So the maximum number for the base is a 4 digit number (5 digits would lead 
to a 10 digit number). 
- Besides the maximum 4 digit number is 9876 because the final number must
be pandigital.
- We can brute force every number from 1 to 9876, compute the products
from the base and check if the concatenation is 9 digit and pandigital.
- In the end we return the biggest number.
