Description:

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 
is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4. If all the 
permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it 
lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1, and 2 are:

012, 021, 102, 120, 201, 210.

What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9?

Solution:

- The number of total permutation possible is 1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10=10!
- 10! = 3_628_800
- Ideally we must generate permutation in sorted order and we stop at the 1_000_000th permutations
