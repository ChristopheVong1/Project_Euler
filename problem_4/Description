Problem:

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009=91*99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Solution:

Brute forcing: We can calculate every product of two 3-digit numbers (from 100*100 to 999*999) and we make a list of every palindromes. Finally, we return the biggest number.

Reverse palindrome: Make a list of every palindrome possible between 10000 and 998001 and then check for factors.
