Description:

- The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by:
tn=1/2*n(n+1)

So, the first ten triangle numbers are:
1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55,…
1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55,…

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26) and summing these values, we form a word value. For example:

SKY = 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10​. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Given a list of English words in words.txt (provided in the problem), how many are triangle words?

Solution:

- We need a list of triangle numbers (using the formula). Words can't be too long so we can stop at around 2000.
- We need a function to compute a word value based on its letter.
- We need a function to convert the .txt file into a list of words, then we can iterate that list to check the triangle number criteria
