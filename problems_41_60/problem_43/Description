Description:

- The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.

Let d₁ be the 1st digit, d₂ be the 2nd digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following:

    d₂d₃d₄ = 406 is divisible by 2
    d₃d₄d₅ = 063 is divisible by 3
    d₄d₅d₆ = 635 is divisible by 5
    d₅d₆d₇ = 357 is divisible by 7
    d₆d₇d₈ = 572 is divisible by 11
    d₇d₈d₉ = 728 is divisible by 13
    d₈d₉d₁₀ = 289 is divisible by 17

Find the sum of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property.

Solution:

- It seems easy by brute forcing every possible number but there is lot of numbers to test. We can instead use permutations from itertools to avoid computing billions of numbers.
- First we need to find the list of 10 digit pandigital (function already made previously to find pandigital)
- Then we need to make a new function to create new numbers based on the digits and check if they are divisible by exactly 2, 3, 5, ..., 17.
- Finally, we return the sum of all pandigital numbers.
- We can optimize the problem by generating the number from the end to the front. First we can find every 3 digit numbers that are multiple of 17 (no duplicate digit), then work backward by finding every number that can create a 3 digit number divisible by 13, ...
