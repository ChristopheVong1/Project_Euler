Description:

Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n*(3n-1)/2. The 
first ten pentagonal numbers are:

1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

It can be seen that P4+P7=22+70=92=P8. However, their difference, 
70-22=48, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum 
and difference are pentagonal and D=|Pk-Pj| is minimised; 
what is the value of D?

Solution:

- We need to test first make a list of pentagonal numbers (limit ?)
- We also need to a function to test if a number is pentagonal
- Then test each pair and compute the sum and difference and check if they are pentagonal
- Also we want D minimum so it is the first valid pair because the pentagonal numbers grow quadratically

- If we study a number x: x=n*(3n-1)/2, we can find 3nÂ²-n-2*x=0
- Which results in: n=(1+sqrt(1+24x))/6
- n is an integer so sqrt(1+24x) is also an integer and 1+sqrt(1+24x) must be divisible by 6
- To find the first pair, we compute each Pk, then compute every Pj for j<k and test the sum and difference
- If every condition are fulfilled we return the pair
