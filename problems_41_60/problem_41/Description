Description:

- We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is also prime.

- What is the largest n-digit pandigital prime that exists?

Solution:

- We want a pandigital (9 digit number using 1 to 9) and a prime.
- We need a function to test prime (see previous problem)
- We need a function to test pandigital (see previous problem)
- We can test numbers in descending order from 987_654_321 to 123_456_789 and we return the first result.

- There is a math trick that says if the sums of digit are divisible by 3, then the whole number is divisible by 3.
- If 9 digit: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=45 --> divisible by 3
- If 8 digit: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8=36 --> divisible by 3
- If 7 digit: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28 --> not divisible by 3
- If 6 digit: 1+2+3+4+5+6=21 --> divisible by 3
- If 5 digit: 1+2+3+4+5=15 --> divisible by 3
- If 4 digit: 1+2+3+4=10 --> not divisible by 3
--> We have to first look at 7 digit number, then 4 digit number
