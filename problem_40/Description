Description:

- An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers: 0.123456789101112...

It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is 1.

If dn​ represents the nth digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression:

d1×d10×d100×d1000×d10000×d100000×d1000000d1​×d10​×d100​×d1000​×d10000​×d100000​×d1000000​

Solution:

- We can brute force the solution by creating the string and stopped when there are at least 1_000_000 digits by concatenating.
- Then we extract the digits at the 1, 10, 100, ... positions to make the product.
