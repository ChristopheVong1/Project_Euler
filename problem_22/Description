Description:

Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K 
text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting
it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value 
for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in 
the list to obtain a name score.

Example: COLIN=3+15+12+9+14=53, it is also the 938th names in the list.
Its final score is 938*53=49714.

What is the total of all name scores in the file ?

Solution:

Seems easy by brute forcing (maybe long sorting).
- Open the file names.txt and extract the name list
- Sorting the list in alphabetical order
- Create a function to give the alphabetical value score for a letter (A=1, B=2)
- Create a function that give the score for a name using above and its position
- Sum the final list
