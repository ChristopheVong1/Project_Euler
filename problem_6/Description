Problem:

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 385.
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is 3025.
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025-385=2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Solution:

Seems easy using brute forcing.
- Make a function to calculate the sum of squares of X natural numbers
- Make a function to calculate the sum of first X natural numbers
- Make the difference

There is also another method (not implemented) using a mathematical identity:
(Σn)² - Σ(n²) = n(n+1)(3n²-n-2)/12 (for n=100: 25,164,150)
